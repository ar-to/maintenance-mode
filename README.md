# Maintenance Mode

Use this repo to facilitate creation of a custom page that serves as a maintenance page for you site in Apache. It uses .htaccess to let Apache know to return a 503 error and load a custom html page inside the same directory.

### File placement

Add the files in this repo to the root of you site via FTP. Add a custom logo.png and full viewport image so you replace the default unplash.com and placehold.it images.
